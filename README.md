# C++ starter repository

Starter repo for basic C++ projects

## Purpose and goal

My goal is to have a project to practice my C++ and don't let dust settle on my knowledge. For that, I create a started repo, which has a build system and some basic functionality. Copying this repo I can start building simpler console applications.

For simplicity I decided to use Google products mostly. GTest is out of question for me, because it's a very powerful and widely used testing framework which is completed by GMock. For the other purposes I will mostly use Google products:

- **Build system**: Bazel
- **Testing**: GTest and GMock
- **Logging**: glog
- **Benchmarking**: Google Becnhmark
- **Abseil**: library for handling command line arguments

I also will set up GitHub actions and pretend with my workflow that it's a real project with a team.
